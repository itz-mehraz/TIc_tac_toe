# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains three versions of a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## Versions

### Human vs Human

In this version, two human players can play against each other on the same device. Each player takes turns clicking on the cells to make their moves.

### Human vs AI

In this version, a human player can play against an AI opponent. The AI opponent makes random moves, providing a challenge for the human player.

### AI vs AI

In this version, two AI opponents play against each other. Each AI player makes random moves, resulting in automated gameplay.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Play

   - For AI vs AI: Run `ai_vs_ai.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How the Code Works

- Each version of the game is implemented using Python classes and methods.
- The graphical user interface is created using Tkinter, a Python library for creating GUIs.
- For the AI versions, the AI opponent makes random moves by selecting an empty cell on the board.
